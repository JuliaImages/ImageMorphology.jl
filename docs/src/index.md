# ImageMorphology.jl

This package provides morphology operations for structure analysis and image processing.

!!! info "setup"
    ImageMorphology is a sub-package of the umbrella package Images.jl -- either `using
    Images` or `using ImageMorphology` will give you access to this functionality.

## Installation

Just like all normal Julia packages, you can use
[Pkg](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/getting-started/) to install it:

```julia
pkg> add ImageMorphology # hit ] to enter Pkg mode
```

## Learn

The perhaps quickest way to use this library is to find a set of useful operators from the
[gallery](@ref op_index) and build your own pipeline from it.

For any advanced usage, we recommend you to read the "Concept" part. For instance, many morphology
operation supports generic ["structuring element"](@ref concept_se).

## Overview

The following tables give an overview of ImageMorphology functionalities.

!!! note "ðŸš§ work in progress"
    This overview is not yet finished and only contains a subset of exported functions. The missing
    functions will be added in the future. You might still need to check the heavy [reference](@ref
    reference_index) page to find out what you need. Contributions are welcome!

### Structuring Element (SE)

Structuring element is the key concept in morphology. If you're not familiar with this, please read
[concept: structuring element](@ref concept_se) first.

| name                          | summary |
| :---------------------------- | :------ |
| [`strel`](@ref)               | convert between different SE representations    |
| [`strel_type`](@ref)          | infer the SE type                               |
| [`strel_size`](@ref)          | get the minimal block size that contains the SE |
| [`strel_chain`](@ref) and [`strel_product`](@ref) | compose multiple SEs into a bigger one |
| [`strel_box`](@ref)           | construct a box-shaped SE, e.g., C8, C26 connectivity |
| [`strel_diamond`](@ref)       | construct a diamond-shaped SE, e.g., C4, C6 connectivity |
| [`centered`](@ref OffsetArrays.centered) | shift the array center to `(0, 0, ..., 0)`    |
