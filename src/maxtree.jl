"""
Max-tree morphological representation of an image.

# Details
Let's consider a *thresholding* operation,
```julia
    mask = [val ≥ threshold for val in image]
```
One can identify the connected components (the sets of neighboring true values)
in `mask`. When *image thresholding* is sequentially applied for all possible
thresholds, it generates a collection of connected components that could be
organized into a hierarchical structure called *component tree*. Consider 1D
"image" with values 1, 2 and 3:
```
       2233233312223322
```
The connected components would be
```
    1: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
    2: BBBBBBBB.CCCCCCC
    3: ..DD.EEE....FF..
```
Here, the letters are the labels of the resulting connected components,
and `.` specifies that the pixel value is below the threshold.
In this example, the corresponding *component tree* is:
```
      A
     ⭩ ⭨
    B   C
   ⭩ ⭨   ⭨
  D   E   F
```

A *max-tree* is an efficient representation of the *component tree*.
A connected component ``C`` at threshold level ``t`` is represented by the
single *reference pixel* ``r`` from this level (`image[r] == t`), which is the
parent to all other pixels of ``C`` and also to the *reference pixels* of the
connected components at higher thresholds, which are the children of ``C``.
In our example, the reference pixels (denoted by the letter of the corresponding
component) would be:
```
    1: ........A.......
    2: B........C......
    3: ..D..E......F...
```
I.e.

| Comp | Ref.Pixel |
| ---- | ---------:|
| *A* |  9 |
| *B* |  1 |
| *C* | 10 |
| *D* |  3 |
| *E* |  6 |
| *F* | 13 |

So the whole max-tree could be encoded as a vector of indices of parent pixels:
```
9  1  1  3  1  1  6  6  9  9 10 10 10 13 10 10
```

The *max-tree* is the basis for many morphological operators,
namely connected operators. Unlike morphological openings and closings, these
operators do not require a fixed structuring element, but rather act with a
flexible structuring element that meets a certain criterion.

  components (including the root one) are below `min_attr`

# Details
This function is the basis for [`area_opening`](@ref), [`diameter_opening`](@ref)

their first ancestral component (in *max-tree* representation of `image`)

# Details
Area opening is similar to morphological opening (see [`opening`](@ref)),
but instead of using a fixed structuring element (e.g. disk) it employs
small (less than `min_area`) components of the *max-tree*. Consequently,
the `area_opening` with `min_area = 1` is the identity transformation.

In the binary case, area opening is equivalent to `remove_small_objects`;
this operator is thus extended to gray-level images.

# Arguments
- `image::GenericGrayImage`: the ``N``-dimensional input image
- `min_area::Number=64`: the smallest size (in pixels) of the image component
  to keep intact
- `connectivity::Integer=1`: the neighborhood connectivity. The maximum number
  of orthogonal steps to reach a neighbor of the pixel.
  In 2D, it is 1 for a 4-neighborhood and 2 for a 8-neighborhood.
- `maxtree::MaxTree`: optional pre-built *max-tree*. Note that
  `maxtree` and `connectivity` optional parameters are mutually exclusive.

# Examples
Creating a test image `f` (quadratic function with a maximum in the center and
4 additional local maxima):
```jldoctest; setup = :(using ImageMorphology)
julia> w = 12;

julia> f = [20 - 0.2*((x - w/2)^2 + (y-w/2)^2) for x in 0:w, y in 0:w];

julia> f[3:4, 2:6] .= 40; f[3:5, 10:12] .= 60; f[10:12, 3:5] .= 80;

julia> f[10:11, 10:12] .= 100; f[11, 11] = 100;

julia> f_dopen = diameter_opening(f, min_diameter=3, connectivity=1);
```
The peaks with a maximal diameter of 2 or less are removed.
For the remaining peaks the widest side of the bounding box is at least 3.

end

"""
    area_closing(image, [maxtree]; min_area=64, connectivity=1) -> Array

Performs an *area closing* of the `image`.

*Area closing* replaces all dark components of an image that
have a surface smaller than `min_area` with the brighter value taken from
their first ancestral component (in *max-tree* representation of `image`)
that has the area no smaller than `min_area`.

# Details
*Area closing* is the dual operation to *area opening* (see [`area_opening`](@ref)).
It is similar to morphological closings (see [`closing`](@ref)),
but instead of using a fixed structuring element (e.g. disk) it employs
small (less than `min_area`) components of the *max-tree*. Consequently,
the `area_closing` with `min_area = 1` is the identity transformation.

In the binary case, area closing is equivalent to
`remove_small_holes`; this operator is thus extended to gray-level images.

# Arguments
- `image::GenericGrayImage`: the ``N``-dimensional input image
- `min_area::Number=64`: the smallest size (in pixels) of the image component
  to keep intact
- `connectivity::Integer=1`: the neighborhood connectivity. The maximum number
  of orthogonal steps to reach a neighbor of the pixel. In 2D, it is 1 for
  a 4-neighborhood and 2 for a 8-neighborhood.
- `maxtree::MaxTree`: optional pre-built *max-tree*. Note that
  `maxtree` and `connectivity` optional parameters are mutually exclusive.

# Returns
An array of the same type and shape as the `image`.
